# AI_P1 (Frozen Lake - MDP)

## Value Policy Iteration

This project implements the value iteration algorithm for solving the FrozenLake-v1 environment in OpenAI Gym. The algorithm iteratively updates the value function and finds the optimal policy for the given environment.

### Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python and the gymnasium library installed. You can install the necessary dependencies using pip:

```shell
pip install gymnasium
```

### Usage

To run the value policy iteration algorithm and print the resulting value function, execute the following command:

```shell
python main.py
```

You can modify the maximum number of iterations and other parameters in the `Value_policy_iteration` function inside `main.py`.
